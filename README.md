Title :- 📱 Mobile App for Direct Market Access for Farmers
🌾 Project Overview

Mobile App for Direct Market Access for Farmers is a digital platform designed to eliminate middlemen in agricultural trade by directly connecting farmers with consumers and retailers.

Farmers often struggle to access fair markets, which results in lower profits due to intermediaries. This application bridges that gap by enabling farmers to list their produce, negotiate prices, and manage transactions directly with buyers.

The goal is to increase transparency, improve income potential, and empower farmers through technology.

🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers frequently face:

❌ Limited direct access to markets

❌ Dependence on middlemen

❌ Reduced profit margins

❌ Lack of price transparency

❌ Limited bargaining power

These challenges restrict their ability to sell produce at fair prices.

💡 Proposed Solution

This mobile application provides:

✅ Direct connection between farmers and buyers

✅ Produce listing with images and pricing

✅ Price negotiation features

✅ Order and transaction management

✅ Secure authentication system

By reducing dependency on intermediaries, the platform enhances farmers' income opportunities.
